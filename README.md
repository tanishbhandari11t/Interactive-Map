# Interactive World Map

An interactive, web-based world map application that allows users to explore countries with a rich, visual experience. This project features hover effects, click interactions, zoom controls, and a detailed side panel for displaying country information.

## 📋 Project Overview

This is a fully interactive world map built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application provides an engaging way to explore geographical data by allowing users to interact with an SVG-based world map. Users can hover over countries to see their names in a tooltip, click on countries to view detailed information in a side panel, and use zoom controls to navigate the map at different scales.

## ✨ Features

### Core Functionality
- **Interactive SVG Map**: High-quality, vector-based world map that scales without loss of quality
- **Hover Effects**: Real-time tooltip display showing country names when hovering over regions
- **Click Interaction**: Click any country to view detailed information in a dedicated side panel
- **Zoom Controls**: Three zoom control buttons for enhanced navigation:
  - **Zoom In**: Magnify the map for closer inspection
  - **Zoom Out**: View more of the world at once
  - **Reset Zoom**: Return to the default view instantly

### User Interface
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes and devices
- **Side Panel**: Slide-out panel displaying comprehensive country details
- **Close Button**: Easy-to-use close functionality for the information panel
- **Clean Layout**: Modern, minimalist design with intuitive controls
- **Visual Feedback**: Smooth transitions and hover states for better user experience

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup and structure
- **CSS3**: Styling, animations, and responsive design
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**: Interactive functionality and DOM manipulation
- **SVG**: Scalable Vector Graphics for the map visualization
